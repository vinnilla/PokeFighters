<big><center>Street Fighter w/ Pokemon Starters</center></big>

So far I only have 2 default boxes to check game mechanics. Animations and art have very low priority right now.

<big>Game Mechanics: </big>

Default stats: HP=100   BaseDamage=10   AttackSpeed=10   BlockStrength=10


<big>Attack: P1 : 1 ___ P2 : .</big>

Players must be colliding to attack. The player DPS is based on basedamage and attackspeed.

<small>Combo:

Combo resets after 3 seconds. This countdown will refresh with each hit.

Reaching a 3rd consecutive hit will cause the first evolution -- attack speed doubles

TOIMPLEMENT: Reaching a 6th consecutive hit will cause the second evolution -- damage doubles

Evolution reverts after 5 seconds.
</small>


<big>Block: P1 : 2 ___ P2 : /</big>

When blocking, a player will receive reduced damage (based on blockstrength) and will not suffer from the stun effect.

However, blocking has a cooldown of 3 seconds. Use your blocks wisely.

<big>Stun:</big>

When hit, a player will be stunned for .25 seconds (cannot retaliate in that time.) However, the player can still block.




<small>Planned Features (some may not be implemented in final product):

Dan's Ideas: 

-combo 6 - evolve to final form (wartortle -> blastoise)

Combat:

-Separate attacks into high, normal and low -- probably implement crouching ability as well (attack while crouching to attack low and dodge high attacks at the same time)

  high attacks -- vulnerable spot so more damage

  low attacks -- faster, but less damage

Movement:

-Jumping(???)

-dashing forward and backward to quickly engage/disengage</small>
