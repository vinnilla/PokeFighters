Street Fighter w/ Pokemon Starters
So far I only have 2 default boxes to check game mechanics. I have object collison, hit detection and blocking working. I plan on adding more functionality as I go. Animations and art have very low priority right now.

Planned Features (some may not be implemented):

Dan's Ideas: 

-combo 3 - evolve to secondary form (squirtle -> wartortle)

-combo 6 - evolve to final form (wartortle -> blastoise)

-evolutions (increased stats) last for 5 seconds

Combat:

-Separate attacks into high, normal and low -- probably implement crouching ability as well (attack while crouching to attack low and dodge high attacks at the same time)

  high attacks -- vulnerable spot so more damage

  low attacks -- faster, but less damage

Movement:

-Jumping(???)

-dashing forward and backward to quickly engage/disengage
